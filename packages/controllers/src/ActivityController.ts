/**
 * ActivityController — the stateful layer over the per-chain transaction
 * normalizers, producing one merged, deduped, chronologically-sorted activity
 * feed.
 *
 * This is stackr's analog of MetaMask's `TransactionController` + the
 * activity-list pipeline that renders on top of it — generalized from one chain
 * to four. The services package already draws the anti-corruption boundary
 * (ADR 0012): each chain's raw provider response is normalized to a domain
 * `Transaction` behind `fetchTransactions(chain, address)`. This controller adds
 * what a *feed* needs that a single chain's list does not:
 *
 *   1. **Fan-out.** One `refresh` queries every watched address across every
 *      chain in parallel (the four normalizers behind the ACL).
 *   2. **Enrichment.** Each `Transaction` becomes an `Activity` tagged with its
 *      feed `source`, the `wallet` it belongs to, a normalized `direction`, and
 *      a coarse `category`.
 *   3. **Dedupe + merge-sort.** Entries are deduped on `(chain, hash)` and
 *      merge-sorted by timestamp into a single descending feed.
 *
 * Like every controller it owns its state privately and announces changes on
 * `:stateChange`; the dashboard "recent activity" panel and the wallet-detail
 * transaction list become thin mirrors of this feed via `useController`.
 *
 * The wallet set it refreshes is the union of two inputs, mirroring the issue's
 * two triggers:
 *   - **Connected accounts** arrive through the messenger by subscribing to
 *     `WalletConnectionController:stateChange` — no reference to that
 *     controller, exactly the decoupling PortfolioController uses.
 *   - **Watch-only addresses** are pushed in via `setWatchedWallets`, the bridge
 *     from the Zustand wallet store (which lives in the app, not a controller).
 * Either changing re-runs the feed, with no UI glue in between.
