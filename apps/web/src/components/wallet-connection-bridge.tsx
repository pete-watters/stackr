/**
 * Collapses `connected-address-sync.tsx` + `connected-solana-address-sync.tsx`
 * into a single controller-backed bridge. A WalletConnectionController owns the
 * EVM and Solana connection state (the two chains those components mirrored),
 * and this bridge mirrors that state into `wallet-store.connectedAddresses` so
 * every existing consumer keeps working unchanged — purely additive.
 *
 * Stacks/Leather is intentionally NOT bridged here: it already has its own
 * session-restore-and-mirror path in `use-wallet-connections.ts`, and routing it
 * through the controller too would double-write its addresses. The Stacks
 * adapter still exists and is exercised in /labs; folding the Leather path into
 * the controller is left as follow-up (ADR 0015).
 *
 * The controller is built inside the effect (client-only), so wagmi's
 * `watchAccount` and the Solana adapter's listeners are never registered during
 * a server render, and both are torn down on unmount.
